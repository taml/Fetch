# 🐶 Fetch

This project utilises JavaScript, Vue, HTML and CSS to fetch and display pictures of dogs via an API. 

The API parsed is [Dog API](https://dog.ceo/dog-api/) which returns either a `message` Object containing a list of dog breeds/subbreeds or an Array containing a list of pictures and an API `status`.

This project also uses some cartoon dog graphics courtesy of [Pixabay](https://pixabay.com/) and icons from [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/).

##### Features
+ ✔️ Filtering dog breeds/subbreeds by letters A-Z
+ ✔️ Pagination for list of photos
+ ✔️ Adaptive, responsive design
+ ✔️ Accessibility Consideration (colour ratios, aria labels and tab order)
+ ✔️ Local Store (Pinia) for managing state

Instructions for running and building the project can be found below.
