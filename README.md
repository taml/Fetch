# 🐶 Fetch

This project utilises JavaScript, Vue, HTML and CSS to fetch and display pictures of dogs via an API. 

The API parsed is [Dog API](https://dog.ceo/dog-api/) which returns either a `message` Object containing a list of dog breeds/subbreeds or an Array containing a list of pictures and an API `status`.
